# An analysis of daily accidents in UK from 2014 to 2017 using Time Series
A simple time series regression to understand the different steps of modelization

## Introduction
 One of the specificity of regression linear is using the previous value of the dependent variable to predict the future value. Time series can be really frustrating as it implies that you have to find correlation between the lag or errors of any previous prediction. Due to its complexity, the Data Scientist got lost sometimes in the process of modelization of times series. Im this bolg I am going to share a full time series anlayiss using one of the well known Data Science method: OSEMIN. 


## Context and Data used
The data used for this analysis contained the date and amount of  1461 daily accidents in the UK from January 1st, 2014 to December 31, 2017. I get the data from kaggle (link:...) No other variables were considered in this analysis. The main purpose of this study is to present a full data science project. Other objectives are to find out if the number of accidents in a day is dependent of the number of accidents in any given day. The 3 questions that the study is seeking to answer are:
1. Was is the relation between the amount of accident on a current day and the day prior?
2. Is there any pattern that can help predict the amount of acccident in UK on any given day?
3. Is the month of the year related to the number of accident during that month?

In the study, we will define accident as xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
