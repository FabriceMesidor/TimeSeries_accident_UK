# An analysis of daily accidents in UK from 2014 to 2017 using Time Series
     A simple time series regression to understand the different steps of modelization

## Introduction

Linear regression is a very common model used by Data Scientist. An outcome or target variable is explained by a set of features. There is a case where the same variable is collected over time and we used a sequence of measurements of that varaible. Most often, the measurements are made at regular time intervals. We talk about Time Series.
One difference from standard linear regression is that the data are not necessarily independent and not necessarily identically distributed. Working with time series can be really frustrating as it implies that you have to find correlation between the lag or errors of any previous prediction. Also the ordering matters and changing the order will change the meaning of the data.
Due to its complexity, Data Scientist got lost sometimes in the process of modelization of times series. In this bolg I am going to share a full time series analysis using one of the well known Data Science method: OSEMIN. 


## Context and Data used
The data used for this analysis contained the date and amount of  1461 daily accidents in the UK from January 1st, 2014 to December 31, 2017. I get the data from kaggle (link:...) No other independent variables were considered in this analysis. 

The main purpose of this study is to explain the different steps of a full data science project. 
Other objectives are to find out if the number of accidents in a day is dependent of the number of accidents in any given day. 

The 3 questions that the study is seeking to answer are:
1. What is the relation between the amount of accident on a current day and the day prior?
2. Is there any pattern that can help predict (or prevent) the amount of acccident in UK on any given day?
3. Is the month of the year or day of week related to the number of accident during that month?

In the study, we will define accident as xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
